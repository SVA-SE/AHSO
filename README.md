# Animal Health Surveillance Ontological Framework (AHSO)

AHSO has been reviewed to create a FRAMEWORK of complementary ontologies, rather than a single ontology.

AHSO will be deprecated, and substituted by a

Health Surveillance Ontology

and an

Animal Health Ontology.

Visit [data-driven surveillance.org](http://datadrivensurveillance.org/ontology) for the most up to date information.
